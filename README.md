#### Go lang is a statical language with garbage collection, concurrent features developed by Google. Concurrency is known as making progress on multiple tasks simultaneously within one program. Go has a rich support for this using goroutines and channels. In this project, as greenhands in Go, we aims at exploring  the cool features of Go, especially in concurrency.
